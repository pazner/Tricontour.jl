= Tricontour.jl

This package provides functionality for drawing contour lines, filled contour
regions, and pseudocolor plots for data defined on unstructured triangular
meshes in Julia. The plotting functionality is based on
https://gr-framework.org[GR]. The algorithm is inspired by
https://matplotlib.org[matplotlib].

== Examples

Some simple examples are provided in `examples/example.jl`.
